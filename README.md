> ## Overview
<p align="justify">
Nestcoin is a filmhouse that would like to further engage with their audience. They would like to create a currency which would be used to reward loyal customers. The curremcy would later be traded for backstage passes and other perks.

#
> ## Create the SmartContract
  - First write the Smartcontract codes within the contracts folder.
  - The next step involves the compilation, deployment and verification of the contract on the testnet.

> ### Compile
- To compile the smartcontract before deployment:
```
$ npx hardhat compile
```
#
> ### Deploy
- To deploy the smartcontract:
```
$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
#
> ### Verify
- To verify the smartcontract:
```
$ npx hardhat verify 0x43f71fbd58e9600924f49a53c6fde787977c2b9d --network rinkeby "0x33d57e4712e4c4dc6ff50e3319e1e79d7eabc937"
```
Note* - the first contract written after verify in the code is the `Nestdrop.sol` address recieved after the deployment while the second contract after rinkeby is the `Nestcoin.sol` address
#
> ## Setup the Frontend
- First run the frontend on your local server to ensure it's fully functional before building for production.
#
> ### Install Dependencies
- Setup and install dependencies

```shell
$ cd frontend

$ npm install

$ npm install react-scripts@latest
```
#
> ### Start Server
- Start the server on localhost
```
$ npm run start
```
#
> ### Build the Frontend
- Create an optimized production build, which can be hosted on sites like Heroku, Netlify, Surge etc.
```
$ npm run build
```
#
> ## Testing the Smartcontract

- Coverage was used to view the extent of our tests and unittests were implemented to ensure that the code functions as expected
#
> ### Coverage
- Install Solidity Coverage
```
  $ npm i solidity-coverage
```
- Add `require('solidity-coverage')` to hardhat.config.json

- Install Ganache
``` 
  $ npm i install ganache-cli
``` 
- Run coverage
```
$ npx hardhat coverage --network localhost
```
#
> ### Test

- To test the smartcontract, first open a terminal and run the following command:

``` 
$ npx hardhat node
```
- Leave the previous terminal running and open new terminal. 
- Run the command below:
```
$ npx hardhat test --network localhost
```
